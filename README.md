This is my attempt at a 3D Engine for the mmorpg ROSE Online, hopefully it will eventually be able to render in full accuracy everything from the game!

So far it has support for loading any item in the game and rendering it on a player with full animation support, and support for rendering any NPC from its ID. The next large feature I aim to add is particle effect rendering.

Credits are deserved for Brett as this is based off some of his previous work and even uses some code and concepts from his Halia engine which powers the Ikarus client. Much manlove for him.
